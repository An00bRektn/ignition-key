# Ignition Key
> March 19, 2022 | An00bRektn

This repository contains an automated setup script various VMs so I can get my preferred tools set up quickly.

Inspired by John Hammond's [ignition-key](https://github.com/JohnHammond/ignition_key/blob/master/ignition_key.sh) script, and Dewalt's [pimp-my-kali](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali) script.

### TODO
- [x] Windows Dev machine setup using choco + pwsh
    - [x] Test the Windows dev install script
- [x] Test Ubuntu script
- [x] More wallpapers and/or terminal customization?
- [ ] patch out the PEP668 stuff everyone is trying to do (remove the `/usr/lib/python3.x/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` file)

**NOTE**: Author assumes zero liability for any data loss or misuse (or use) of the script. Can be used on a bare metal machine, but that's on you.
